                <p>
                    Born and raised in Illinois, my academic and employment journey has taken me to 5 states and the District of 
                    Columbia. From a Wildlife Researcher to Environmental Consultant into a career in Education as a Special Education
                    teacher. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My developer journey started in earnest in 2016 when I graduated from <a href="https://mcckc.edu/">Metropolitan
                    Community College</a> with an Associate's degree in Software Development. Immediately I was able to put what I learned
                    to practice as a Computer Teacher in the Kansas City Missouri Public Schools system. In 2018, I started a position as an 
                    Application Engineer at <a href="https://amusementconnect.com/">Amusement Connect</a>. The breadth of my experience has enabled
                    me to take a leadership role in techincal support, software support and networking. 
                    I'm very excited to continue my journey with LaunchCode, both with an eye to use the skills I learn in my current position, or
                    expand to a new role at a different company.
