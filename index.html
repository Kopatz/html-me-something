                <p>
                   Illinois raised, I have lived in 6 different states since 2003, and have been in Kansas 
                   City since 2013. My education and work history is wide ranging, from my past as a wildlife researcher, 
                   then Water Quality Specialist, to my almost 10 years of teaching experience.I started my journey as a 
                   developer in 2016 when I completed my Associates in Software Development at Metropolitan Community 
                   College in Kansas City. However, Life happend, so I needed to continue teaching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2018, while in what became my last year of teaching, I started part-time work with Amusement Connect.
                    My work as an Application Engineer has fostered my desire to work with my hands and problem solve, it
                    also gives me the potential to grow into a developer role, and LaunchCode is a perfect stepping stone
                    toward that end. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Though I'm not sure where my developer journey will lead me, but I am certainly excited by the possibilities.
